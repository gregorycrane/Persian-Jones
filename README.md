Our goal is to produce
a digital edition of the Persian Grammar by Sir William Jones with entries in the glossary marked that appear in examples in the text. The digital text here builds on the [1804 sixth edition available from the Internet Achive](https://archive.org/details/grammarofpersian00joneiala).

There are several reasons to focus upon a grammar that was first published in 1771 -- and, indeed, the 250th anniversary in 2021 might be an appropriate target.

First, the grammar was itself widely influential, with many editions produced over many years. Knowledge of Persian was of practical value insofar as Persian had emerged as a language of government and commerce. Jones ultimately succeeded in his desire to serve as a judge in India -- like so many other English, he benefited materially from his position but he never saw England again.

Second -- and for me even more compelling -- is the approach of the grammar itsself. There is virtually no artificial textbook Persian. Jones presents authentic Persian from the start. As soon as he introduces "Of Nouns and First of Genders", he uses <i>maʾšuq</i> and <i>maʾšuqah</i> to contrast masculine and feminine versions of the same word. Jones then illustrates this term by quoting a (somewhat racy) line of poetry:

> <i>gol dar bar o mey dar kaf o maʾšuq be kām ʾast</i>

> مَن اَز آن حُسنِ روزاَفزون که یوسُف داشت دانِستَم

> Flowers are in my bosom, wine in my hand; and my mistress yields to my desire.

As a teacher of Ancient Greek and Latin, 

> When he can express his sentiments in Persian
with tolerable facility, I would advise him to read some
elegant history or poem with an intelligent native, who
will explain to him in common words the refined expressions
that occur in reading, and will point out the beauties of
learned allusions and local images. (xvi)
